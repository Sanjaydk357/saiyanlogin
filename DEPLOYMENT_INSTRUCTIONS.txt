Deployment Instructions for PHP User Authentication App

1. Requirements:
   - A web hosting service that supports PHP and MySQL (e.g., shared hosting, cPanel, or cloud providers)
   - Access to phpMyAdmin or MySQL command line to create the database and tables

2. Database Setup:
   - Import the users.sql file into your MySQL server to create the database and users table.
     You can do this via phpMyAdmin or command line:
     mysql -u your_username -p < users.sql

3. Configuration:
   - Update the db.php file with your hosting MySQL credentials:
     - $servername
     - $username
     - $password
     - $dbname

4. Upload Files:
   - Upload all PHP files (db.php, index.php, register.php, dashboard.php, logout.php) to your web server's public directory (e.g., public_html).

5. Access the Application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to your domain or IP address.
   - You should see the login page.
   - Register a new user and log in to access the dashboard.

6. Security Recommendations:
   - Use HTTPS to secure data transmission.
   - Set proper file permissions on your server.
   - Consider additional security measures for production use.

7. Troubleshooting:
   - Check PHP error logs if you encounter issues.
   - Ensure your hosting environment meets PHP and MySQL version requirements.

This completes the deployment setup for your PHP user authentication application.
